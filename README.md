# Forecasting Validation Project

Welcome to the Forecasting Validation Project repository, which contains scripts and analyses dedicated to validating tools and methodologies within the Forecasting Task Team (TT) of the LSST DESC.

## Overview

This repository provides resources for validating key DESC tools, including:
- **CCL** (Core Cosmology Library): Cosmology calculations and modeling
- **Firecrown**: Likelihood and cosmological parameter estimation
- **Augur**: Forecasting and parameter inference framework
- **TJPCov**: Covariance computation library for cosmological analyses

Together, these tools are used to forecast and validate cosmological models and statistical inferences as part of DESC's broader objectives. 

## Contents

- **Scripts**: Automation and computation scripts for forecasting workflows.
- **Analysis**: Detailed analyses and validation results for the Forecasting TT project.
- **Configuration**: Configurations and sample `.ini` and `.yaml` files to reproduce forecasting setups.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages for each tool. Example commands and more detailed usage instructions can be found in the corresponding directories.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
