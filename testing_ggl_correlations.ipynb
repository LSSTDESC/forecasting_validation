    "# Testing assumptions for the GGL Lens/Source combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "The current SRD requires that the GGL measurement should only be performed with a given lens/source combination if $\\left<z_\\mathrm{lens}\\right> < \\left<z_\\mathrm{source}\\right>$ and the overlap of the two N(z)'s is < 10%. In this notebook we test to see if those assumptions are valid. These combinations are removed because it is expected that the signal will be very low, and will give us little cosmological information. Recent results from Cross & SÃ¡nchez (2024) show that while having lenses in front of the sources (Inverse Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing, or IGGL) does give small signal, it can still help measure instrinsic alignments (IA) and magnification bias, which can in turn improve constraints obtained by traditional GGL. This notebook explores these \"forbidden\" combinations to see what information we can extract from GGL, and balance that against the computation time required for adding the forbidden measurements.
